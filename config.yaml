    content: |-
       I am a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, based at the University of California, Berkeley, where I work with Professor Joseph Shapiro. Previously, I worked at the <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/predoctoral-research-fellowship-opportunities">Stanford Institute for Economic Policy and Research</a>, and the <a href="https://www.heal-project.eu/"> University of Mannheim</a>. I graduated with highest distinction from the University of Iowa with a B.S. in Mathematics and Economics in 2021.
            
        My fields of interest are environmental/public economics, industrial organization, and health. In general, I focus on incentives in environmental settings. These incentives are created by interactions of natural resource availability, instutitutional policy, and market structures. 
            
        I will be attending Yale University's School of the Environment starting in Fall 2024 as an NSF Graduate Student Fellow.
